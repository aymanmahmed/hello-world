# hello-world
my very first repository
Hi! I am Ayman, a 22 year old from Auburn Alabama. I'm starting my journey in code after getting my bachelor's in biomedical sciences from Auburn University. My goal is to become a physician with skills in programming and data analysis. I want to be at the forefront of data-driven medical solutions and the process toward equalizing access to medicine.
